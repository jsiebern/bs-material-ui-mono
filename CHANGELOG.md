## 1.0.0
* :rocket: Bump to version 1.0.0 of the bindings (Because I think that the general way of the bindings won't change much from now on)
* :rocket: Updated to MaterialUi v3.8.1
* :rocket: Added bindings to `@material-ui/icons` (needs to be installed separately) **WARNING**: Currently broken (includes the whole icons package, fix coming down the road)
* :rocket: Added properly typed theme (see examples!)
* :rocket: Added `theme => ReactDOMRe.Style.t` functionality for the ppx

## 0.4.3
* :rocket: Updated to MaterialUi v3.2.2
* :rocket: Added `xsAuto` ,`smAuto` ,`mdAuto` ,`lgAuto` ,`xlAuto` properties to the `Grid` component (will override their respective set properties if defined)
* :rocket: `mui.withStyles` generated components now accept a single child **OR** a render prop (no `...` array spread when using as a `HOC`)

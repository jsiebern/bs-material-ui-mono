# Important: Version 1.0.0

I have changed the bindings version to 1.0.0 to reflect the fact that there probably won't be any structural / breaking changes in the future to come.

The bindings now include all icons, as well as an (almost) fully typed theme support as well.

**Please make sure to look at the [changelog](https://github.com/jsiebern/bs-material-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the breaking changes!**

I hope that I haven't forgotten any breaking changes in my list, please open an issue should you come across any.

# Reason bindings for material-ui

This library provides Reason bindings for
[material-ui](https://material-ui-next.com/). It's automatically generated by
[reason-mui-binding-generator](https://github.com/jsiebern/reason-mui-binding-generator).

## Installation (for your Reason project)

Run:

    yarn add @jsiebern/bs-material-ui

to add the library to your project dependencies. And add `@jsiebern/bs-material-ui` to the `bs-dependencies` node of your `bsconfig.json`.

## Installation of the `withStyles` code extension (ppx)

Install the package: `yarn add --dev @jsiebern/bs-material-ui-ppx`.

(The PPX builds on the fly using `bsb-native`. This is a quite heavy dependency and takes a while but will ensure that the PPX runs on your system)

Add the entry `./node_modules/@jsiebern/bs-material-ui-ppx/ppx` to the `ppx-flags` node of your `bsconfig.json`.

## Example

Please see [the examples folder](https://github.com/jsiebern/bs-material-ui/tree/master/examples).
(Running the example code: `yarn examples`)

## withStyles

In material-ui, the `withStyles` [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) takes care of turning React styles into CSS via [react-jss](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss). It passes a `classes` prop onto the component with the first level keys of the style object passed on.

HOC do not translate well into Reason which is why we are using a [render prop](http://reactpatterns.com/#render-callback) to make things easier. [(More information on the topic).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcVAq3YFiuc)

## withStyles Example PPX (typesafe)

**Make sure you have implemented the ppx file (see installation for reference)**

**Important: In order to use `theme => styles` you need to provide a `<MaterialUi_ThemeProvider theme={MaterialUi_Theme.create()}>` at the top of the tree!**

The code extension allows you to write a typesafe styled component with ease. It follows the format `[%mui.withStyles "ComponentName"({ className: ReactDOMRe.Style.t })]`. The generated Component has a render function which passes on a `record` with the class keys. See the example below.

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("Example");

[%mui.withStyles
  "StyledExample"({
    alignRight:
      ReactDOMRe.Style.make(~width="100%", ~textAlign="right", ()),
  })
];

let make = _children => {
  ...component,
  render: _self =>
    <StyledExample>
      ...{
        classes =>
          <div className={classes.alignRight}>
            "Example text - aligned to the right"->ReasonReact.string
          </div>
      }
    </StyledExample>,
};
```

## withStyles Example (unsafe)

You need to pass a `classes` prop of type `list( { name: string, styles: ReactDOMRe.Style.t } )` and a `render` function to the component. See the following example:

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("Example");

let make = _children => {
  ...component,
  render: _self =>
    <MaterialUi.WithStyles
      classes=[
        {
          name: "alignRight",
          styles:
            ReactDOMRe.Style.make(~width="100%", ~textAlign="right", ()),
        },
      ]
      render={
        classes =>
          <div className=classes##alignRight>
            "Example text - aligned to the right"->ReasonReact.string
          </div>
      }
    />,
};
```

## Colors

All Colors are accessible in Submodules of the Module `Colors`. Color keys that are a pure number begin with a `c`. [(MUI Docs Reference).](https://material-ui-next.com/style/color/)

Example:

```reason
[%mui.withStyles
  "ColorExample"({
    bgColor: ReactDOMRe.Style.make(~backgroundColor=MaterialUi.Colors.Red.c300, ())
  })
];
```

## Overriding with classes

To take advantage of Reasons type system when overriding classes directly on components they have been converted into Variants and need to be passed as a `list` to the components `classes` prop. It is best used in combination with the `MaterialUi.WithStyles` component.

[(MUI Docs Reference).](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/customization/overrides/#overriding-with-classes)

Example:

```reason
let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("Example");

[%mui.withStyles
  "OverrideExample"({
    fontSize: ReactDOMRe.Style.make(~fontSize="30px", ()),
    bgColor:
      ReactDOMRe.Style.make(
        ~backgroundColor=MaterialUi.Colors.Red.c300,
        (),
      ),
  })
];

let make = _children => {
  ...component,
  render: _self =>
    <OverrideExample>
      ...{
        classes =>
          <MaterialUi.Button
            color=`Primary
            variant=`Contained
            classes=[
              Root(classes.fontSize),
              RaisedPrimary(classes.bgColor),
            ]>
            "Example Button"
          </MaterialUi.Button>
      }
    </OverrideExample>,
};
```

# Important: Version 1.1.0

There are a few backsteps and important changes in 1.1.0:

-   I have removed the icons again in favor of this package: [@mscharley/bs-material-ui-icons](https://github.com/mscharley/bs-material-ui-icons)
    This package basically contains them in the way I would have published them in their own package, so I can't see any need to do so anymore.
-   This repo is now a mono-repo managed by lerna as managing this project got a little out of hand.
    _Important: The packages still should be treated separately when playing around with the code, as there are a great many steps involved in actually getting to the end result._
    _Even more important: I do not guarantee that the build process will work for you. I have tried to generalize it a bit but it's still quite messy. It's good enough for me if I can use it personally to publish the bindings. Feel free to send PRs that alleviate the pain for others a bit._
